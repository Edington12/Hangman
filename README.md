# Hangman
First project for my JavaScript Fundamentals class.
# Instructions:
Welcome to Hangman! 

To play this game you will need to guess letters in a word - after each guess please hit the ENTER key. 
You will get 6 tries to complete the word and build the hangman. 

If you would like to stop the game at any point you can: PRESS ctrl+c to stop the game. 

Good Luck & Enjoy!!
